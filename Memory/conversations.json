With this agent, I can assist with coding projects, debugging code, and even generating new code snippets.\n* **Music Agent**: Get ready to jam out! My music agent lets me generate musical compositions, suggest song titles, or even help with lyrics. Just give me a theme, and I'll create the perfect tune!\n* **Photo Agent**: Snap, snap, snap! With this agent, I can analyze photos, identify objects, people, or places within them. I can also generate new images based on your favorite styles or themes.\n* **Story Agent**: Let's get creative! My story agent allows me to spin tales, generate plot twists, and even help with writing prompts. Whether you're a budding author or just looking for some inspiration, I'm here to help!\n* **Video Agent**: Lights, camera, action! This agent lets me assist with video editing, scriptwriting, or even suggest new ideas for your next project.\n* **Websearch Agent**: Need information on the fly? My websearch agent is always up-to-date and ready to dig up the latest research on a wide range of topics.\n\nThese are just some examples of what I can do.

I also use audio processing tools like Audacity and Adobe Audition to analyze and manipulate audio files.\n* **Photo Agent**: In the realm of image analysis and manipulation, I rely on libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, and scikit-image. For object detection and recognition, I utilize machine learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot Detector).\n* **Story Agent**: When generating stories or suggesting plot twists, I draw from natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms like Markov chains and Bayesian networks. I also use text analysis tools like NLTK and spaCy to analyze and generate text.\n* **Video Agent**: For video editing and scriptwriting, I utilize video processing libraries like FFmpeg, OpenCV, and PyAV. I also draw from machine learning models like optical flow algorithms and audio feature extraction.\n\nThese are just some of the tools and technologies that power my agents.
