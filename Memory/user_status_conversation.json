That's a fascinating topic! Let me share some more tidbits about our sense of smell.\n\nDid you know that:\n\n* Our sense of smell is closely linked to memory and emotions? This is why certain smells can evoke strong memories or emotions in us.\n* The human nose has around 350-400 types of olfactory receptors, which are responsible for detecting different scents. However, we can detect an astonishing number of unique odors due to the combination of these receptors and our brain's processing power!\n* Some animals have a much more developed sense of smell than humans do. For example, dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors, while bloodhounds have around 1 billion!\n\nWould you like to know more about our sense of smell or explore another topic?\n\nType \"more\" for additional facts, or choose a new topic by typing \"new\"!",

This is why certain smells can evoke strong emotions or memories, such as the scent of freshly baked cookies reminding you of your grandmother.\n* The human nose can detect pheromones, which are chemical signals that convey information about an individual's reproductive status, dominance, or other social cues. This plays a crucial role in animal communication and mating rituals!\n* Some people have a condition called anosmia, where they lose their sense of smell due to age-related decline, head trauma, or certain medical conditions.
