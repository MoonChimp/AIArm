Let's get started!\n\nTo confirm, what would you like me to do first? Would you like me to:\n\n1. **Scan the system** for available tools and programs?\n2. **Install a missing tool**, such as Python or Node.js?\n3. **Create a custom capability**, like a web scraper or a Python script?\n4. **Bootstrap myself** with any required functionality?\n\nPlease respond with one of these options, and I'll get started!",
