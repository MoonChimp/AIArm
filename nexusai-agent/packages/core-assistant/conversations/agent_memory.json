BARA (Flatbread) Ingredients:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon instant yeast\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n- 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n- Warm water (about 3/4 cup)\n- Oil for frying\n\n2. CURRY CHANNA Ingredients:\n- 2 cans chickpeas (or 2 cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight)\n- 2 tablespoons curry powder\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 2 sprigs culantro (chadon beni) or cilantro\n- 2 teaspoons geera (ground cumin)\n- Scotch bonnet pepper to taste (optional)\n- Salt to taste\n- Black pepper to taste\n\n3. CONDIMENTS (Traditional):\n- Tamarind sauce\n- Cucumber chutney\n- Hot pepper sauce\n- Mango chutney (optional)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFor the Bara:\n1. Mix flour, yeast, salt, cumin, turmeric, and sugar in a bowl\n2. Add warm water gradually while kneading to form a soft dough\n3. Cover and let rise for 1.5 hours\n4. Divide into small balls (about golf ball size)\n5. Roll each ball very thin (they should be about 4-5 inches in diameter)\n6. Fry in hot oil until lightly golden (they should puff up)\n\nFor the Curry Channa:\n1. Heat oil in a large pot\n2. Sauté onion and garlic until translucent\n3. Add curry powder and geera, cook for 1 minute\n4. Add drained chickpeas and enough water to barely cover\n5. Add culantro/cilantro, scotch bonnet (if using), salt, and pepper\n6. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until chickpeas are tender and sauce is thick\n7. Slightly mash some chickpeas to thicken the curry\n\nAssembly:\n1. Take two pieces of bara\n2. Place a generous spoonful of curry channa on one bara\n3. Add your choice of condiments (traditionally tamarind sauce and pepper sauce)\n4. Cover with the second bara\n5. Wrap in paper if serving street-style\n\nKey Tips:\n- The bara should be very thin and slightly puffy when fried\n- The curry channa should be thick but still have some sauce\n- Traditionally eaten hot and wrapped in paper\n- Can be quite spicy - adjust heat levels to preference\n- Best served immediately while bara is still warm\n\nCultural Note:\nDoubles is a quintessential Trinidadian street food with roots in Indian cuisine, brought by indentured laborers to Trinidad. It's typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack, and vendors often have their own secret recipes and techniques that make their doubles unique.\n\nThis recipe serves approximately 6-8 doubles. Preparation time is about 2.5 hours (including dough rising time), and cooking time is approximately 45 minutes.\n\nWould you like me to create a detailed shopping list or focus on any particular aspect of the recipe?\nuser: open google\n\nCurrent message: open google\n\nYou are in ACT mode.

BARA (Flatbread) Ingredients:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon instant yeast\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n- 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n- Warm water (about 3/4 cup)\n- Oil for frying\n\n2. CURRY CHANNA Ingredients:\n- 2 cans chickpeas (or 2 cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight)\n- 2 tablespoons curry powder\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 2 sprigs culantro (chadon beni) or cilantro\n- 2 teaspoons geera (ground cumin)\n- Scotch bonnet pepper to taste (optional)\n- Salt to taste\n- Black pepper to taste\n\n3. CONDIMENTS (Traditional):\n- Tamarind sauce\n- Cucumber chutney\n- Hot pepper sauce\n- Mango chutney (optional)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFor the Bara:\n1. Mix flour, yeast, salt, cumin, turmeric, and sugar in a bowl\n2. Add warm water gradually while kneading to form a soft dough\n3. Cover and let rise for 1.5 hours\n4. Divide into small balls (about golf ball size)\n5. Roll each ball very thin (they should be about 4-5 inches in diameter)\n6. Fry in hot oil until lightly golden (they should puff up)\n\nFor the Curry Channa:\n1. Heat oil in a large pot\n2. Sauté onion and garlic until translucent\n3. Add curry powder and geera, cook for 1 minute\n4. Add drained chickpeas and enough water to barely cover\n5. Add culantro/cilantro, scotch bonnet (if using), salt, and pepper\n6. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until chickpeas are tender and sauce is thick\n7. Slightly mash some chickpeas to thicken the curry\n\nAssembly:\n1. Take two pieces of bara\n2. Place a generous spoonful of curry channa on one bara\n3. Add your choice of condiments (traditionally tamarind sauce and pepper sauce)\n4. Cover with the second bara\n5. Wrap in paper if serving street-style\n\nKey Tips:\n- The bara should be very thin and slightly puffy when fried\n- The curry channa should be thick but still have some sauce\n- Traditionally eaten hot and wrapped in paper\n- Can be quite spicy - adjust heat levels to preference\n- Best served immediately while bara is still warm\n\nCultural Note:\nDoubles is a quintessential Trinidadian street food with roots in Indian cuisine, brought by indentured laborers to Trinidad. It's typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack, and vendors often have their own secret recipes and techniques that make their doubles unique.\n\nThis recipe serves approximately 6-8 doubles. Preparation time is about 2.5 hours (including dough rising time), and cooking time is approximately 45 minutes.\n\nWould you like me to create a detailed shopping list or focus on any particular aspect of the recipe?\nuser: open google\nassistant: Unable to process request - all agents failed\nuser: save in text format\nassistant: Unable to process request - all agents failed\nuser: hi\n\nCurrent message: hi\n\nYou are in ACT mode.
