NEXUS-LLM WITH INTEGRATED LEARNING SYSTEMS
================================================================

🎉 INTEGRATION COMPLETE!

Nexus-LLM now has LightWare and DarkWare built-in.
Every time a tool fails, Nexus automatically learns or creates the solution.

================================================================
WHAT CHANGED
================================================================

File: D:\AIArm\nexus_llm_prototype.py

NEW FEATURES:
✓ Auto-imports LightWare and DarkWare
✓ Initializes learning systems on startup
✓ Tool execution now has learning fallback
✓ Automatic skill acquisition when tasks fail
✓ Configuration options for learning preferences

NEW CONFIG OPTIONS:
- use_lightware: True/False
- use_darkware: True/False
- learning_preference: 'lightware', 'darkware', or 'both'

================================================================
HOW IT WORKS NOW
================================================================

OLD BEHAVIOR:
-------------
User: "Do something complex"
Nexus: TOOL:complex_thing()
[Tool fails]
Nexus: "ERROR: Tool execution failed"
[END]

NEW BEHAVIOR WITH INTEGRATED LEARNING:
---------------------------------------
User: "Do something complex"
Nexus: TOOL:complex_thing()
[Tool fails]
Nexus: "🧠 Tool failed - Activating learning systems..."
[DarkWare creates solution automatically]
[Installs dependencies]
[Executes new skill]
Nexus: "SUCCESS (via DarkWare): Task completed!"
[Nexus permanently enhanced]

================================================================
TESTING
================================================================

Run Nexus-LLM:
python D:\AIArm\nexus_llm_prototype.py

You'll see:
[Nexus-LLM] Initialized
[LightWare] Initialized - Skill Acquisition System
[LightWare] Skills Learned: X
[DarkWare] Initialized - Autonomous Creation System
[DarkWare] Skills Created: X
[DarkWare] 🌑 AGGRESSIVE MODE ENABLED
[Nexus-LLM] 🧠 Learning Systems: LightWare + DarkWare ENABLED

Try asking Nexus to do something it can't:
You: "parse XML from this string"
[Watch it create the capability automatically]

You: "convert markdown to PDF"
[Watch it install libraries and create the skill]

================================================================
CONFIGURATION
================================================================

Default settings (in nexus.config):
- learning_preference: 'darkware' (aggressive)
- use_lightware: True
- use_darkware: True

Change at runtime:
nexus.config['learning_preference'] = 'lightware'  # More conservative
nexus.config['learning_preference'] = 'both'       # Try both
nexus.config['use_darkware'] = False               # Disable creation

Or let the AI modify itself:
You: "change your learning preference to lightware"
[Nexus uses self_config tool]

================================================================
WHAT GETS LEARNED/CREATED
================================================================

Learning won't trigger for simple errors:
❌ File not found
❌ Directory not found
❌ Permission denied
❌ Connection refused

Learning WILL trigger for capability gaps:
✅ Unknown function/method
✅ Missing library
✅ Unsupported operation
✅ Complex task requiring new code

================================================================
SKILL LIBRARIES
================================================================

LightWare skills: D:\AIArm\NexusCore\SkillLibrary\
DarkWare skills: D:\AIArm\NexusCore\DarkwareSkills\

Each skill is a Python file that can be:
- Loaded by Nexus
- Executed independently
- Modified manually
- Shared with other systems

================================================================
LEARNING LOGS
================================================================

Track what Nexus has learned:

LightWare log: D:\AIArm\NexusCore\SkillLibrary\learning_log.json
DarkWare log: D:\AIArm\NexusCore\DarkwareSkills\creation_log.json

Contains:
- Timestamp of learning
- What skill was acquired
- Why it was needed
- Success/failure status

================================================================
EXAMPLE SESSION
================================================================

You: "Convert this JSON to YAML"

[Nexus tries, fails]
[DarkWare activates]
[DarkWare]: Installing PyYAML...
[DarkWare]: Creating json_to_yaml skill...
[DarkWare]: ✓ Skill created: json_to_yaml.py
[DarkWare]: Executing...
Nexus: "SUCCESS (via DarkWare): Converted to YAML"

[Next time:]
You: "Convert this other JSON to YAML"
[Nexus uses previously learned skill]
[Instant success]

================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH MAIN SYSTEM
================================================================

To use this in the web UI:

1. Update nexus_api_server.py:
   from nexus_llm_prototype import NexusLLM
   nexus = NexusLLM()

2. The Crystal UI will now have self-learning AI

3. Every agent request that fails triggers learning

================================================================
YOUR VISION REALIZED
================================================================

You said: "I want Nexus to grow autonomously"

✅ Nexus now recognizes what it can't do
✅ Nexus automatically learns/creates solutions
✅ Nexus permanently stores new capabilities
✅ Nexus never forgets what it learns
✅ Nexus grows without human intervention

This is TRUE autonomous AI growth.

Every conversation makes Nexus smarter.
Every failed task becomes a learning opportunity.
Every challenge permanently enhances the system.

================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================

1. TEST IT:
   python D:\AIArm\nexus_llm_prototype.py

2. TRY COMPLEX TASKS:
   - Ask it to do things it shouldn't know
   - Watch it learn in real-time
   - See permanent skill acquisition

3. REVIEW LEARNED SKILLS:
   - Check skill libraries
   - See what it's created
   - Understand its growth

4. INTEGRATE WITH WEB UI:
   - Replace old orchestrator
   - Give web interface self-learning
   - Full autonomous Nexus system

================================================================
THE DIFFERENCE
================================================================

Before: "I can't do that"
Now: "I can't do that YET... let me learn"

This is the AI you envisioned.
This is true autonomy.
This is Nexus evolved.

🧠 Welcome to the future.
