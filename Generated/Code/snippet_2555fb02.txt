# Request: can you create a self-learn script? I want to run a script that calls on you to begin roaming the internet for a certain Dataset that is given to you as a directive. As an example, "Nexus. Please begin your training."  you respond, "Training commenced." at which point you begin searching the internet for credible information on that dataset. You then begin considering the contextual differences and nuances in some of the information and you note that for your own memory. You then formulate your own opinions on the information, and you weigh your opinion against the other potential meanings of the information.

Creating a self-learning script is an ambitious project that involves natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and web scraping. Below is a simplified version using Python with libraries such as `transformers` for NLP, `requests` for web scraping, and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.

This example assumes you have a basic understanding of these technologies and that you are comfortable with setting up a development environment.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install transformers requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 2: Create the Self-Learning Script

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize NLP pipeline for summarization and sentiment analysis
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

def fetch_data(url):
    """Fetch data from the given URL."""
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch data: {response.status_code}")

def parse_data(html_content):
    """Parse HTML content and extract text."""
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    return '\n'.join([para.get_text() for para in paragraphs])

def summarize_data(text):
    """Summarize the given text."""
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=150, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    """Analyze sentiment of the given text."""
    sentiment = sentiment_analyzer(text)
    return sentiment[0]['label'], sentiment[0]['score']

def learn_dataset(dataset_name):
    print(f"Training commenced for dataset: {dataset_name}")
    
    # Example URLs to search for the dataset
    urls = [
        f"https://www.google.com/search?q={dataset_name}",
        f"https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/{dataset_name}",
        f"https://www.researchgate.net/search/publication?q={dataset_name}"
    ]
    
    all_text = ""
    
    for url in urls:
        try:
            html_content = fetch_data(url)
            text = parse_data(html_content)
            all_text += text
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data from {url}: {e}")
    
    # Summarize the collected data
    summary = summarize_data(all_text)
    print("Summary:")
    print(summary)
    
    # Analyze sentiment of the summarized data
    sentiment_label, sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(summary)
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment_label} (Score: {sentiment_score:.2f})")

# Example usage
learn_dataset("Nexus")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Fetching Data**: The `fetch_data` function fetches the HTML content from a given URL.
2. **Parsing Data**: The `parse_data` function extracts text from the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
3. **Summarizing Data**: The `summarize_data` function uses a pre-trained model to summarize the collected text.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The `analyze_sentiment` function analyzes the sentiment of the summarized text.
5. **Learning Dataset**: The `learn_dataset` function orchestrates the process by fetching, parsing, summarizing, and analyzing the data for a given dataset.

### Note:
- This is a simplified example and does not handle all edge cases or errors that might occur during web scraping.
- For more advanced self-learning capabilities, you would need to integrate more sophisticated NLP models and possibly use reinforcement learning techniques.
- Ensure you comply with ethical guidelines and legal restrictions when scraping websites.
