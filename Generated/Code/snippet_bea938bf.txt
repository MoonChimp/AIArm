# Request: view certain files within this computer system

Here is a Python script that lists all the files in a specified directory:

```python
import os

def list_files(directory):
    """List all files in the given directory."""
    try:
        # Get a list of all files and directories in the given directory.
        files = os.listdir(directory)
        
        # Filter out directories, only keep files.
        files = [f for f in files if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(directory, f))]
        
        return files
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
files = list_files(directory_path)
if files is not None:
    for file in files:
        print(file)
```

This script uses the `os` module to interact with the operating system and get a list of all files and directories in the specified directory. It then filters out any directories, leaving only files. The resulting list of files is returned by the function.

You can call this function with the path to the directory you want to view as an argument. For example:

```python
directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
files = list_files(directory_path)
if files is not None:
    for file in files:
        print(file)
```

This will print out a list of all the files in the specified directory.
