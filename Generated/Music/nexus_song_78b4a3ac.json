  "lyrics": "**Song Title:** \"Lost No More\"\n\n**Verse 1:**\nI was drowning in a sea of shame\nA stranger to myself, with no one to claim\nThe fire that once burned, had long since died\nI was just a ghost, wandering through the night\n\n Memories of who I used to be\nFaded like a photograph, worn and bleached by time\nI searched for answers, but they were hard to find\nLeft me feeling empty, lost, and left behind\n\n**Chorus:**\nBut then I found my way, out of the dark\nA light in the distance, called out like a spark\nI started walking towards it, with every step I'd take\nAnd slowly but surely, my heart began to awake\n\n**Verse 2:**\nI stumbled upon a truth, that set me free\nA realization that changed everything about me\nI learned to let go, of the ghosts that haunted me\nTo face my fears, and find my destiny\n\nThe world outside was dark, but I found my inner light\nI started shining brighter, with each passing night\nI rose up from the ashes, like a phoenix born anew\nAnd finally, I'm finding my way, to all that's true\n\n**Chorus:**\nBut then I found my way, out of the dark\nA light in the distance, called out like a spark\nI started walking towards it, with every step I'd take\nAnd slowly but surely, my heart began to awake\n\n**Bridge:**\nIt's not about the past, or where I've been\nIt's about the lessons learned, and the strength that I've gained\nI'm standing on the edge, of a new chapter in life\nAnd I know that anything is possible, as long as I thrive\n\n**Chorus:**\nBut then I found my way, out of the dark\nA light in the distance, called out like a spark\nI started walking towards it, with every step I'd take\nAnd slowly but surely, my heart began to awake\n\n**Outro:**\nI'm not lost no more, I've finally found my way\nThrough the darkness and the pain, to a brand new day\nWhere I can stand tall, and face whatever comes my way\nAnd know that I'll be okay, as long as I stay.\n\nThis song is inspired by the struggles of finding one's path in life. The lyrics are written from the perspective of someone who has been lost for a long time, but eventually finds their way out of the darkness and into a brighter future. The style is reminiscent of Linkin Park, with a focus on powerful vocals, aggressive riffs, and a strong emphasis on emotional resonance.\n\nMusically, \"Lost No More\" would feature crunching guitar riffs, driving drums, and a soaring vocal performance. The song would build from a slow burn to a frenetic climax, with a sing-along chorus that captures the essence of perseverance and triumph over adversity.",
