**Title:** "Uplifting Pulse"

**Description:** A simple yet energizing instrumental piece featuring a pulsing bass line, accompanied by lively melodic motifs and rhythmic variations.

**Musical Elements:**

* **Melody (Theme):** The main melody is played on the right hand (RH) of the violin. It's a short, catchy phrase that follows the 2-4-2 pattern: C - E - G - A - C (repeated).

	+ Measure 1-2: Quarter notes (downbeat)
