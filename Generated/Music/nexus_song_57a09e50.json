  "lyrics": "**Song Title:** \"Echoes of Betrayal\"\n\n**Verse 1:**\nIn the depths of Babylon's pride\nWhere golden statues touched the sky\nA promise made, a bond did bind\nBut now the chains of deceit are left behind\n\nThe winds of war began to howl and moan\nAs friends turned foes, and brothers overthrown\nThe scent of smoke and sacrifice in air\nAs kingdoms crumbled, leaving only despair\n\n**Chorus:**\nEchoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear\nWhispers of a forgotten tear\nIn the ruins of a once-proud throne\nThe voices of the fallen ones are thrown\n\n**Verse 2:**\nFrom the hills of Jerusalem's grief\nTo the valleys where the prophets left\nTheir words unheeded, their warnings ignored\nAs darkness spread, and light was no more\n\nThe fire of passion dwindled to embers low\nAs hearts turned cold, and love did slow\nIn the silence, a cry went unheard\nAs the weight of history crushed like thunder\n\n**Chorus:**\nEchoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear\nWhispers of a forgotten tear\nIn the ruins of a once-proud throne\nThe voices of the fallen ones are thrown\n\n**Bridge:**\nAnd when the dust settles, and the wars subside\nWill we remember the lessons left inside?\nOr will we repeat the mistakes of old?\nAs the echoes whisper tales of gold?\n\n**Chorus:**\nEchoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear\nWhispers of a forgotten tear\nIn the ruins of a once-proud throne\nThe voices of the fallen ones are thrown\n\n**Outro:**\nIn the darkness, where shadows play\nThe ghosts of memory will have their say\nAnd when the world is quiet and still\nThe echoes of betrayal will forever chill.\n\nThis song is inspired by the Aramaic Lords' style, with a focus on heavy metal elements. The lyrics explore themes of betrayal, power struggles, and the consequences of neglecting the warnings of prophets. The song's message is one of caution, urging listeners to learn from history and avoid repeating past mistakes.",
