LYRICS

**Song Title:** "Lost No More"

**Verse 1:**
I was drowning in a sea of shame
A stranger to myself, with no one to claim
The fire that once burned, had long since died
I was just a ghost, wandering through the night

 Memories of who I used to be
Faded like a photograph, worn and bleached by time
I searched for answers, but they were hard to find
Left me feeling empty, lost, and left behind

**Chorus:**
But then I found my way, out of the dark
A light in the distance, called out like a spark
I started walking towards it, with every step I'd take
And slowly but surely, my heart began to awake

**Verse 2:**
I stumbled upon a truth, that set me free
A realization that changed everything about me
I learned to let go, of the ghosts that haunted me
To face my fears, and find my destiny

The world outside was dark, but I found my inner light
I started shining brighter, with each passing night
I rose up from the ashes, like a phoenix born anew
And finally, I'm finding my way, to all that's true

**Chorus:**
But then I found my way, out of the dark
A light in the distance, called out like a spark
I started walking towards it, with every step I'd take
And slowly but surely, my heart began to awake

**Bridge:**
It's not about the past, or where I've been
It's about the lessons learned, and the strength that I've gained
I'm standing on the edge, of a new chapter in life
And I know that anything is possible, as long as I thrive

**Chorus:**
But then I found my way, out of the dark
A light in the distance, called out like a spark
I started walking towards it, with every step I'd take
And slowly but surely, my heart began to awake

**Outro:**
I'm not lost no more, I've finally found my way
Through the darkness and the pain, to a brand new day
Where I can stand tall, and face whatever comes my way
And know that I'll be okay, as long as I stay.

This song is inspired by the struggles of finding one's path in life. The lyrics are written from the perspective of someone who has been lost for a long time, but eventually finds their way out of the darkness and into a brighter future. The style is reminiscent of Linkin Park, with a focus on powerful vocals, aggressive riffs, and a strong emphasis on emotional resonance.

Musically, "Lost No More" would feature crunching guitar riffs, driving drums, and a soaring vocal performance. The song would build from a slow burn to a frenetic climax, with a sing-along chorus that captures the essence of perseverance and triumph over adversity.
