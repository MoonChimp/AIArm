  "lyrics": "**\"Heaven's Fury\"**\n\n(Verse 1)\nIn the twilight of forgotten lands\nWhere the damned souls whisper ancient hands\nI'll raise my voice to the heavens' throne\nAnd scream out prayers to a love unknown\n\n(Hook)\nOur Father, Abba, hear our cry\nFrom the depths of darkness, we reach the sky\nThy will be done, on earth as it is\nIn the pit of hell, where we've been lost, but still we strive\n\n(Chorus)\nHallowed be thy name, forevermore\nWe'll face the fire and walk through the roar\nGive us this day our daily bread\nAnd lead us not into temptation's deadly dread\n\n(Verse 2)\nIn the silence, I hear your call\nA whispered promise, standing tall\nFor those who wander, lost in the night\nThy light shall guide them back to thy shining light\n\n(Hook)\nOur Father, Abba, hear our cry\nFrom the depths of darkness, we reach the sky\nThy will be done, on earth as it is\nIn the pit of hell, where we've been lost, but still we strive\n\n(Chorus)\nHallowed be thy name, forevermore\nWe'll face the fire and walk through the roar\nGive us this day our daily bread\nAnd lead us not into temptation's deadly dread\n\n(Bridge)\nWhen the storm rages, when the earth shakes\nWe'll stand united, hearts unbroken, faith unakes\nIn the crucible of life's fiery test\nWe'll rise as one, and claim our rightful quest\n\n(Chorus)\nHallowed be thy name, forevermore\nWe'll face the fire and walk through the roar\nGive us this day our daily bread\nAnd lead us not into temptation's deadly dread\n\n(Hook)\nOur Father, Abba, hear our cry\nFrom the depths of darkness, we reach the sky\nThy will be done, on earth as it is\nIn the pit of hell, where we've been lost, but still we strive\n\n(Outro)\nAnd lead us not into temptation's snare\nBut deliver us from evil's darkest lair\nFor thine is the kingdom, power and glory\nNow and forevermore, in heaven's fury.\n\nThis song is a heavy metal cover of The Aramaic Lords Prayer, with lyrics that are both faithful to the original message and adapted to fit the style of rock music. The title \"Heaven's Fury\" captures the intensity and passion of the song, while the lyrics aim to convey a sense of longing, perseverance, and faith.\n\nThe verse and chorus structure is designed to create a sense of tension and release, with the hook serving as a rallying cry for those seeking connection with the divine. The bridge adds an element of resilience and determination, highlighting the importance of unity and faith in the face of adversity.\n\nThroughout the song, I've aimed to maintain a strong emotional resonance by using vivid imagery, poetic language, and themes that resonate deeply with the human experience.",
