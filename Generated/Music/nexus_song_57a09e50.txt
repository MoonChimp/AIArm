**Song Title:** "Echoes of Betrayal"

**Verse 1:**
In the depths of Babylon's pride
Where golden statues touched the sky
A promise made, a bond did bind
But now the chains of deceit are left behind

The winds of war began to howl and moan
As friends turned foes, and brothers overthrown
The scent of smoke and sacrifice in air
As kingdoms crumbled, leaving only despair

**Chorus:**
Echoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear
Whispers of a forgotten tear
In the ruins of a once-proud throne
The voices of the fallen ones are thrown

**Verse 2:**
From the hills of Jerusalem's grief
To the valleys where the prophets left
Their words unheeded, their warnings ignored
As darkness spread, and light was no more

The fire of passion dwindled to embers low
As hearts turned cold, and love did slow
In the silence, a cry went unheard
As the weight of history crushed like thunder

**Chorus:**
Echoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear
Whispers of a forgotten tear
In the ruins of a once-proud throne
The voices of the fallen ones are thrown

**Bridge:**
And when the dust settles, and the wars subside
Will we remember the lessons left inside?
Or will we repeat the mistakes of old?
As the echoes whisper tales of gold?

**Chorus:**
Echoes of betrayal ringing loud and clear
Whispers of a forgotten tear
In the ruins of a once-proud throne
The voices of the fallen ones are thrown

**Outro:**
In the darkness, where shadows play
The ghosts of memory will have their say
And when the world is quiet and still
The echoes of betrayal will forever chill.

This song is inspired by the Aramaic Lords' style, with a focus on heavy metal elements. The lyrics explore themes of betrayal, power struggles, and the consequences of neglecting the warnings of prophets. The song's message is one of caution, urging listeners to learn from history and avoid repeating past mistakes.
