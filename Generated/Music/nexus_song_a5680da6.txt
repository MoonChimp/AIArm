**Song Title:** "Lost in the Loop"

**Verse 1:**
I woke up this morning, my phone by my side
The world outside was waiting, but I just couldn't decide
To put it down or pick it up, to let go of the night
As I scrolled through the shadows, I felt my heart take flight

**Chorus:**
But then I realized, I'm lost in the loop
A never-ending cycle, where love and likes do meet
I'm searching for a connection, but it's hard to find
Lost in the loop, where our hearts are left behind

**Verse 2:**
We used to talk about everything, from sunrise to sunset
Now we just share our thoughts, and call it a connection
But beneath the screens and filters, our true selves remain hidden
And I'm left wondering if this love will ever be unbroken

**Chorus:**
But then I realized, I'm lost in the loop
A never-ending cycle, where love and likes do meet
I'm searching for a connection, but it's hard to find
Lost in the loop, where our hearts are left behind

**Bridge:**
Maybe we just need to put down our devices too
And let our love shine through, like the stars shining new
Maybe then we'll find our way, out of this digital haze
And our hearts will beat as one, in a world that's not so phased

**Chorus:**
'Cause then I realized, I'm lost in the loop
A never-ending cycle, where love and likes do meet
I'm searching for a connection, but it's hard to find
Lost in the loop, where our hearts are left behind

**Outro:**
So I'll keep on searching, for that human touch
And hope that someday soon, our love will be enough
To break free from this cycle, and find our way back home
Where our hearts can beat as one, in a world that's made of gold.
