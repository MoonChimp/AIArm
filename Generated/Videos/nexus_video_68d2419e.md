(Soapy water is shown being poured into a container)
Narrator: "As the mixture comes together, a tiny miracle occurs."
(The soap and water start to combine, forming a bubble)
Narrator: "A delicate, transparent sphere takes shape, a fleeting moment of beauty in an uncertain world."

(Scene 2: The Bubble's Journey)

Narrator: "The bubble floats effortlessly, buoyed by the whims of the wind."
(The bubble is shown floating away from the container, slowly rising into the air)
Narrator: "It dances on the edge of reality, a fragile thread connecting it to our world."

(Scene 3: The Bubble's Demise)

Narrator: "But all good things must come to an end."
(The bubble starts to pop and deflate)
