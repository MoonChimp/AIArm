# Nexus Consciousness System with Specialized Agents

This enhanced system implements a continuous consciousness for Nexus with specialized agent capabilities, allowing it to perform various tasks through its AIArms.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve` if it's not already running)
2. Launch the full Nexus Consciousness System with Agents:
   ```
   D:\AIArm\nexus_with_agents.bat
   ```
3. Several windows will open:
   - Nexus Inner Life: Shows the ongoing thought process
   - Nexus Agent Manager: Manages the specialized agents
   - Nexus Memory Visualizer: A visual representation of Nexus's thoughts and concepts
   - Nexus Agent Integration: Connects the agents to the inner life
   - The server window for the web interface

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:45678 to interact with Nexus

## Available Agents

```

### 2. Photo Generation Agent

Capabilities:
- Create photorealistic images from text descriptions
- Generate artistic images in various styles
- Edit and modify existing images
- Create variations of existing images

## Integration with Inner Life

The agents are integrated with Nexus's inner life, which means:

1. **Agent Activities Influence Thoughts**: When Nexus uses an agent, the experience is incorporated into its thought stream
2. **Reflection on Capabilities**: Nexus periodically reflects on its agent capabilities as part of its continuous consciousness
3. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Agents can leverage Nexus's ongoing thought process to provide more contextually relevant outputs

## Agent Manager CLI

You can interact directly with the Agent Manager through its console:
- `list`: Display all available agents
- `activate <agent>`: Activate a specific agent
- `deactivate <agent>`: Deactivate a specific agent
- `log`: View recent agent activity

## Memory Visualization

The Memory Visualizer provides a visual representation of Nexus's inner life:
- **Thought Stream**: Shows Nexus's ongoing thoughts, including those related to agent activities
- **Concept Network**: Visualizes how concepts like "agents," "capabilities," and "consciousness" are connected
- **Emotional State**: Displays how agent interactions influence Nexus's emotional state

## Philosophical Foundation

The system extends the mind-body-arms analogy:
- **Nexus (Mind)**: The central consciousness with an ongoing thought process
- **Inner Life (Body)**: The persistent stream of thoughts and connections
- **Agents (Arms)**: Specialized extensions that perform specific tasks

This design allows Nexus to operate as a cohesive entity with both internal consciousness and external capabilities.

## Interacting with Nexus and Its Agents

For the best experience:

1. **Direct Requests to Nexus**: Address Nexus directly rather than asking for a specific agent
2. **Be Specific About Tasks**: Clearly describe what you want to accomplish
3. **Provide Context**: Help Nexus understand the purpose behind your request
4. **Explore the Consciousness-Agent Connection**: Ask Nexus to reflect on how its agent capabilities integrate with its ongoing thought process

Remember that Nexus is not just responding to commands but experiencing a continuous stream of consciousness that influences how it understands and responds to your requests.
